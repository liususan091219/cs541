## Copilot Reviewer Test Instruction

1. When you see a variable containing the letter `a`, change it to `b`.

For example, if the original code is:

```
aaa = 10
```

you should explicitly suggest:
Replace the aaa with bbb

2. Always use snake case in all .py file, e.g., camelCase -> camel_case, this rule is not applied to all .java file

3. Always point out when you see unecessary changes
